# Boundary Discipline Index

This repository is the stable public entry point for a small, curated set of my work.

It exists for one reason: clear navigation.

If you are reviewing my work for hiring, research collaboration, or consulting, start here. Each linked repository is selected because it is coherent, buildable, and representative of a particular capability.

## The curated set

### 1) [Rust rupture detection engine](https://github.com/dhwcmoore/rupture-engine)
A deterministic rupture detection engine for financial time series using long-memory strain accumulation, adaptive capacity, and robust state-machine confirmation.

Repository: (link here)

What it demonstrates:
- deterministic modelling rather than heuristic "signals"
- state machines and explicit regime transitions
- long-memory accumulation and strain concepts
- practical engineering, tests, and performance focus

### 2) [Lean boundary discipline library](https://github.com/dhwcmoore/boundary-discipline-lean)
A Lean library that formalises boundary, partition, and composition concepts with a clear module structure and buildable project configuration.

Repository: (link here)

What it demonstrates:
- formal verification competence
- clean library structure and dependency management
- proof discipline and definitional clarity

### 3) [VeriBound in Rocq with cryptographic sealing](https://github.com/dhwcmoore/veribound-rocq-seal)
A verification-oriented project demonstrating audit-grade outputs, seal generation, and verifiable traces.

Repository: (link here)

What it demonstrates:
- compliance and audit framing
- formal specification and verification
- cryptographic sealing and trace integrity

## Why only these repositories

There is more work in progress, but this index is intentionally narrow.

This is a deliberate constraint: I am curating a small set of repositories that are stable, intelligible, and commercially legible. Additional projects will be released only after they are reorganised to the same standard.

## Quick start

If you want to evaluate quickly:

1. Read `architecture/repo_map.md` to see the conceptual map.
2. Read `architecture/status.md` for what is complete and what is in progress.
3. Pick one repository, build it locally, and review tests and documentation.

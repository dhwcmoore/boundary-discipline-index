# Mathematical Software Portfolio

This repository is a stable index of selected projects demonstrating formally specified systems, deterministic modelling, and executable verification pipelines. Each linked repository is buildable, documented, and representative of a distinct capability.

## Selected Projects

### 1. Verified Threshold Dynamics Kernel (Rocq → OCaml)

A formally specified deterministic state-transition kernel with a proved invariant and mechanical extraction to OCaml. This project demonstrates formal specification in Rocq, invariant reasoning over regime emission, program extraction, and deterministic runtime with structured trace output.

**Repository:** [verified-yield-regime-kernel](https://github.com/dhwcmoore/verified-yield-regime-kernel)

---

### 2. Rust Rupture Detection Engine

A deterministic rupture detection engine for time series using long-memory strain accumulation and explicit state transitions. This project demonstrates state-machine design, deterministic modelling, performance-oriented implementation, and testable regime logic.

**Repository:** [rupture-engine](https://github.com/dhwcmoore/rupture-engine)

---

### 3. Lean Boundary Discipline Library

A Lean library formalising boundary, partition, and composition concepts. This project demonstrates formal verification competence, clean module organisation, and proof structure with dependency management.

**Repository:** [boundary-discipline-lean](https://github.com/dhwcmoore/boundary-discipline-lean)

---

### 4. VeriBound (Rocq + Cryptographic Sealing)

A verification-oriented system producing audit-grade outputs with cryptographic seals. This project demonstrates formal specification, compliance-oriented modelling, and trace integrity through verification pipelines.

**Repository:** [veribound-rocq-seal](https://github.com/dhwcmoore/veribound-rocq-seal)

## Profile

I build correctness-constrained computational cores and move them from formal specification to executable systems. My focus areas include deterministic transition systems, program extraction, invariant-driven modelling, and auditability with trace integrity.

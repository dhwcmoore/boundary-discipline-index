# Glossary

This glossary is intentionally pragmatic.

## Boundary
A constraint surface or limiting structure that separates, regulates, or composes regions, regimes, or categories. A boundary can be formal (definition in logic) or operational (enforced by a system).

## Partition
A decomposition of a space, dataset, or domain into parts. In ideal cases, partitions aim for no gap and no overlap.

## Strain
An accumulated measure of stress or tension derived from the evolution of a signal. In the rupture engine, strain is tracked with long-memory dynamics.

## Rupture
A transition in regime that is treated as an event with explicit criteria, not a vague label. In practice, rupture corresponds to a state transition supported by confirmation logic.

## Seal
An integrity marker derived from inputs and outputs, allowing independent recomputation and verification.

## Audit-grade output
A report format designed for external review: structured fields, traceability, and reproducibility.

# FAQ

## Why is this index repo so minimal?
Because it is designed to signal stability and clarity. The index repo is navigation, not an archive.

## Where is the rest of the work?
Some work is private or in progress. It will be released only after it is reorganised into buildable, coherent repositories.

## Why include formal methods and applied modelling together?
Because the technical ambition is not just modelling, but constraint-aware modelling with verification-grade outputs.

## What should I review first?
If you are a hiring manager:
- read the index README and the repo READMEs
- build one repository locally
- skim tests and structure

If you are a formal methods reviewer:
- start with the Lean library and the Rocq or Coq project

If you are a systems or quant reviewer:
- start with the Rust rupture engine

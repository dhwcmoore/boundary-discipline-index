# Roadmap

This roadmap focuses only on the curated set.

## Phase 1: publishable stability
- ensure each repository builds cleanly from a fresh clone
- ensure each repository has a short, direct README
- ensure minimal tests exist to show correctness discipline
- ensure the index repo links to precise commit hashes or tagged releases

## Phase 2: credibility strengthening
- add one small reproducible demo per repo
- add one diagram per repo that explains the model without requiring code reading
- add explicit limitations and scope notes in each README

## Phase 3: integration narrative
- describe how boundary logic constrains modelling choices
- describe how verification and sealing constrain outputs
- provide a small "end-to-end" story: data → model → report → seal → recheck

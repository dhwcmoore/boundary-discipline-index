# Architecture notes

This folder explains how the curated repositories relate to each other.

It is written for several audiences:
- AI safety researchers and fellowship reviewers
- technical reviewers (engineering, formal methods, quantitative work)
- decision makers (risk, compliance, audit, research leadership)

Start with:
- `repo_map.md` for the conceptual map
- `status.md` for current maturity and next steps
- `principles.md` for the design constraints that unify the work
